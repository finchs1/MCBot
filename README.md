# Minecraft Discord Chat Bot


Allows Discord users to chat with players on a Minecraft server and the other way around.


Uses the [Spigot (Bukkit) API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit) for the Minecraft server end and the [D++ Discord Library](https://dpp.dev) for the Discord end.


Made to function with 2 servers, can be modified to be more or less. 


Also, it is necessary to replace IDs in the source files to work with your specified Discord bot and server channels.
